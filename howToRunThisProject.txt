Notes for my fellow users:

1)unzip the files into a folder

2)Go to that folder through anaconda prompt

3)after you reach this folder in anaconda prompt use this command:
pip install pipenv


4)then use this command:
pipenv install

5)then use this command:
pipenv shell

6)then use this command:
pipenv install flask

Note: the above commands are nothing but creating an environment for our flask app to run.

7)now to run our py scripts we have to install this:(*** do not exit from the environment, continue after the above commands as is**)

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow==1.14.0
pip install keras==2.3.1
pip install flask-bootstrap

8)once the above lilbraries are installed use these commands:
set FLASK_APP=server
set FLASK_ENV=development

9)type this command finally:
flask run


if it was successfull you will get a message similar to this
 * Serving Flask app "server" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 117-589-614
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)


10)open browser and go to http://localhost:5000/eda


11)Congrats you can play around our project deployed on flask.
